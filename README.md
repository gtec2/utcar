# UTC Alarm Receiver

utcar acts as a central station to a ATS8500 alarm system.

My use case:
* leverage the alarms systems events (e.g. motion, window sensors) as input to home automation

* default port number 12300, can be set on command line

Next:
* add integration for push to HTTP REST (e.g. Openhab integration).  Note: is this direct HTTP push to right way, or should I indirect through MQTT or similar?
