# UTC Alarm Receiver

utcar acts as a central station to a ATS8500 alarm system.

My use case:
* leverage the alarms systems events (e.g. motion, window sensors) as input to home automation

* currently hardcoded to listen on port12300
* currently output to stdout

Next:
* configure port number
* add integration for push to HTTP REST (e.g. Openhab integration)
